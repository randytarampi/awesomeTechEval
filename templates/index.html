<h1>CMPT 470 - Group 17: Team Awesome Tech Evaluation</h1>
<p>We're still working on this. In the mean time, feel free to
  explore. We've got a semi-interesting <a href="/polls">polls</a> 
  app, and a kick-ass (but fairly standard) web <a href="/admin">admin
  </a> interface. Have a look at the links in the corners (in white).</p>
<p>If this wasn't the page you were looking for, you can
  go <a href="javascript:history.go(-1)">back</a> to where 
  you came from, or to the <a href="http://cmpt470.csil.sfu.ca">
  CMPT 470 gateway</a> or
  the <a href="http://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/470/apike/">CMPT
  470 course website</a>.</p>

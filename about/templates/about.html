<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>This isn't really much of a web application - it's more like a
  project containing disparate pluggable Django "apps". This page is
  actually an app all on its own - it's probably the most portable
  (or applicable) module of this project as we're probably porting it
  over to our final project.</p>

<p>We're actually very boring and unimaginative people - hence the
  lack of content - hell, we couldn't even come up with our own CSS,
  we borrowed it from the Django Admin pages. If you've got any ideas
  for project ideas, please don't hesitate to email us at 
  <a href="mailto:cmpt470-team-awesome@sfu.ca">cmpt470-team-awesome@sfu.ca</a></p>

<p>Anyways, we've got a few apps here. Right now, there's 
  this <a href="/about">about</a> page, the <a href="/admin">admin</a>
  site, and a <a href="/polls">polls</a> app, <del>with a few more
  (hopefully) on the way</del> and a half finished <a href="/blog">
  blog</a>.</p>

<h1>About This "App"</h1>

<p>If you're looking at the source code for this page on
  our <a href="https://github.com/randytarampi/awesomeTechEval">GitHub
  Repo</a> then you might have noticed
  that <a href="https://github.com/randytarampi/awesomeTechEval/blob/master/about/templates/about.html">this
  page</a> (more like template for this page) exists in a different
  templates directory - the
  one <a href="https://github.com/randytarampi/awesomeTechEval/blob/master/about/templates">inside</a>
  the "about" app, not the one in the project's
  root <a href="https://github.com/randytarampi/awesomeTechEval/tree/master/templates">
  directory</a>. This is because of portability reasons. Just in case
  you want to recycle a particular Django app, i.e. port it to another
  app, but want to keep the view (template) the same, you can. You can
  even control the granularity like we did, making this page rely on
  our project's
  "<a href="https://github.com/randytarampi/awesomeTechEval/blob/master/templates/base.html"><code>base.html</code></a>".</p>

<p>Cool stuff eh?</p>

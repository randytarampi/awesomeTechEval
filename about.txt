So, as you can see, the project thus far is pretty simplistic.

If you want to poke around the admin interface, you can do it with the
username "awesomeTechEval" and password "aTEpassword12". There
probably isn't much to see there.

Things to note:
	* Custom 404 & 500 Error views: I thought that this was a cool,
	but largely useless feature. Still cool though - I wish I had the
	time to make nice looking screens.

	* Project structure: Like the about page says on the site, it's
	just more of a disparate collection of apps. We have the built-in
	admin app, and a poll app. We're supposed to have two or three
	others, but the learning curve just stopped us like a wall.

	* Templates!: By far the best thing of what we've done. We've got
	a seamless transition between pages (and apps). Try going from the
	polls to the admin interface - we thought it was nice looking (and
	consistent - one of Django's core principles).
